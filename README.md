## About
* Written in Python 2, this juptyer notebook reads lyrics from text files and generates visual analysis against it using numpy, pandas, mathplot, and wordcloud.

## Directions
 1) Update the directory path to a location on your computer. This location should be a folder for the band name.
 2) Within the folder of the band name, directories should include a list of albums. Within each album folder should be the song lyrics in a text file.
 3) Run the notebook and gaze at your results.
